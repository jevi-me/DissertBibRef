	abstract = {How often and how strongly do people experience desires, to what extent do their desires conflict with other goals, and how often and successfully do people exercise self-control to resist their desires? To investigate desire and attempts to control desire in everyday life, we conducted a large-scale experience sampling study based on a conceptual framework integrating desire strength, conflict, resistance (use of self-control), and behavior enactment. A sample of 205 adults wore beepers for a week. They furnished 7,827 reports of desire episodes and completed personality measures of behavioral inhibition system/behavior activation system ({BIS}/{BAS}) sensitivity, trait self-control, perfectionism, and narcissistic entitlement. Results suggest that desires are frequent, variable in intensity, and largely unproblematic. Those urges that do conflict with other goals tend to elicit resistance, with uneven success. Desire strength, conflict, resistance, and self-regulatory success were moderated in multiple ways by personality variables as well as by situational and interpersonal factors such as alcohol consumption, the mere presence of others, and the presence of others who already had enacted the desire in question. Whereas personality generally had a stronger impact on the dimensions of desire that emerged early in its course (desire strength and conflict), situational factors showed relatively more influence on components later in the process (resistance and behavior enactment). In total, these findings offer a novel and detailed perspective on the nature of everyday desires and associated self-regulatory successes and failures. 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved}

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} {\textquotedblleftResearch}-creation\textquotedblright is an emergent category within the social sciences and humanities that speaks to contemporary media experiences and modes of knowing. Research-creation projects typically integrate a creative process, experimental aesthetic component, or an artistic work as an integral part of a study. The focus of this article is how this practice contributes to the research agenda of the digital humanities and social sciences. We discuss how the term has been articulated in academic policy discourses and examine some prominent academic analyses that describe the practice of research-creation. We then unravel, enumerate, and expand upon the concept of research-creation from the purview of Ludwig Wittgenstein\textquoterights notion of \textquotedblleftfamily resemblances\textquotedblright before moving to a discussion of four modes of research-creation: \textquotedblleftresearch-for-creation,\textquotedblright \textquotedblleftresearch-from-creation,\textquotedblright \textquotedblleftcreative presentations of research,\textquotedblright and finally \textquotedblleftcreation-as-research.{\textquotedblrightR}É{SUM}É La « recherche-création » est un domaine naissant en sciences humaines où l\textquoterighton s\textquoterightintéresse aux expériences médiatiques et aux manières de savoir contemporaines. Les projets de recherche-création comportent typiquement un processus créatif, une composante esthétique expérimentale ou une oeuvre artistique. Notre article porte sur la manière dont cette pratique contribue à l\textquoterightagenda de recherche en digital humanities (« humanités numériques ») et en sciences humaines. Nous relevons comment les discours académiques sur les politiques ont traité de la recherche-création et examinons des analyses académiques importantes qui dressent le portrait de celle-ci. Ensuite, nous évaluons et élargissons ce concept en ayant recours à l\textquoterightidée des « ressemblances de famille » telle que développée par Ludwig Wittgenstein, puis pour terminer nous commentons quatre modes de recherche-création : « la recherche pour la création », « la recherche à partir de la création », « les présentations de recherche créatives » et « la création sous forme de recherche ».}

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: We tested predictions from the elaborated intrusion ({EI}) theory of desire, which distinguishes intrusive thoughts and elaborations, and emphasizes the importance of imagery. Secondarily, we undertook preliminary evaluations of the Alcohol Craving Experience ({ACE}) questionnaire, a new measure based on {EI} Theory. {METHODS}: Participants (N = 232) were in correspondence-based treatment trials for alcohol abuse or dependence. The study used retrospective reports obtained early in treatment using the {ACE}, and daily self-monitoring of urges, craving, mood and alcohol consumption. {RESULTS}: The {ACE} displayed high internal consistency and test - retest reliability and sound relationships with self-monitored craving, and was related to Baseline alcohol dependence, but not to consumption. Imagery during craving was experienced by 81\%, with 2.3 senses involved on average. More frequent imagery was associated with longer episode durations and stronger craving. Transient intrusive thoughts were reported by 87\% of respondents, and were more common if they frequently attempted to stop alcohol cognitions. Associations between average daily craving and weekly consumption were seen. Depression and negative mood were associated with more frequent, stronger and longer lasting desires for alcohol. {CONCLUSIONS}: Results supported the distinction of automatic and controlled processes in craving, together with the importance of craving imagery. They were also consistent with prediction of consumption from cross-situational averages of craving, and with positive associations between craving and negative mood. However, this study's retrospective reporting and correlational design require that its results be interpreted cautiously. Research using ecological momentary measures and laboratory manipulations is needed before confident inferences about causality can be made.}

	abstract = {We argue that human desire involves conscious cognition that has strong affective connotation and is potentially involved in the determination of appetitive behavior rather than being epiphenomenal to it. Intrusive thoughts about appetitive targets are triggered automatically by external or physiological cues and by cognitive associates. . When intrusions elicit significant pleasure or relief, cognitive elaboration usually ensues. Elaboration competes with concurrent cognitive tasks through retrieval of target-related information and its retention in working memory. Sensory images are especially important products of intrusion and elaboration, since they simulate the sensory and emotional qualities of target acquisition. Desire images are momentarily rewarding, but amplify awareness of somatic and emotional deficits. Effects of desires on behavior are moderated by competing incentives, target availability and skills. The theory provides a coherent account of existing data and suggests new directions for research and treatment.}

	abstract = {Commentators regularly lament the proliferation of both negative and/or strategic (\textquotedbllefthorse race\textquotedblright) coverage in political news content. The most frequent account for this trend focuses on news norms and/or the priorities of news journalists. Here, we build on recent work arguing for the importance of demand-side, rather than supply-side, explanations of news content. In short, news may be negative and/or strategy-focused because that is the kind of news that people are interested in. We use a lab study to capture participants\textquoteright news-selection biases, alongside a survey capturing their stated news preferences. Politically interested participants are more likely to select negative stories. Interest is associated with a greater preference for strategic frames as well. And results suggest that behavioral results do not conform to attitudinal ones. That is, regardless of what participants say, they exhibit a preference for negative news content.}

This genre is increasingly gaining recognition as a distinct branch of international cinema. This text traces the essay film's origins back to early silent cinema and the abstract, experimental films of artists and then follows its development and the forking of paths into non-fiction `art cinema' and non-fiction film, concluding with recent experiments that blur the distinction between art and film and which seek to transform the essay into a sculptural installation.}
